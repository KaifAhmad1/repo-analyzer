# Enhanced Progress Tracking System

## Overview

The repository analyzer now features an enhanced progress tracking system that replaces the previous ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) system with real-time, stage-based progress bars. This provides users with much better visibility into what's happening during analysis.

## Key Features

### üéØ Stage-Based Progress
Instead of showing just an ETA, the system now displays:
- **Overall progress bar** showing completion percentage
- **Individual stage progress bars** for each analysis phase
- **Real-time tool completion tracking**
- **Current stage and tool indicators**

### üìä Analysis Stages

The system tracks progress through these stages:

1. **üöÄ Initialization** (5% weight)
   - Setting up analysis environment
   - Validating repository access
   - Tools: repository_validation, environment_setup

2. **üìä Data Gathering** (25% weight)
   - Collecting repository structure
   - Reading files and metadata
   - Tools: file_structure, readme_content, directory_listing

3. **üîç Code Analysis** (30% weight)
   - Analyzing code patterns and metrics
   - Complexity analysis
   - Tools: code_metrics, complexity_analysis, pattern_detection

4. **üîí Security Scan** (15% weight)
   - Checking for vulnerabilities
   - Dependency analysis
   - Tools: dependency_scan, credential_check, permission_analysis

5. **üìà Quality Assessment** (15% weight)
   - Evaluating code quality
   - Documentation analysis
   - Tools: documentation_check, testing_analysis, style_analysis

6. **üó∫Ô∏è Visualization** (5% weight)
   - Generating charts and graphs
   - Tools: chart_generation, graph_creation

7. **ü§ñ AI Summary** (5% weight)
   - Generating intelligent insights
   - Tools: ai_analysis, insight_generation

8. **‚úÖ Finalization** (0% weight)
   - Compiling results
   - Preparing final report

### üîß Real-Time Updates

The progress system provides:
- **Live progress updates** as tools complete
- **Current tool indicators** showing what's running
- **Completed tools list** for each stage
- **Stage status indicators** (pending, running, completed)

## UI Components

### Progress Display
```python
def render_enhanced_progress_display(progress_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Render enhanced progress display with stage-based progress bars"""
```

### Stage Progress Bar
Each stage shows:
- Stage name with emoji icon
- Progress bar (0-100%)
- Current tool (if running)
- Completed tools count
- Stage status

### Overall Progress
- Main progress bar
- Overall completion percentage
- Elapsed time
- Current stage indicator

## Usage

### Starting Analysis
```python
# Start tracking analysis
performance_monitor.start_analysis(AnalysisType.QUICK_OVERVIEW, repo_url)
```

### Updating Progress
```python
# Start a stage
performance_monitor.start_stage(AnalysisStage.DATA_GATHERING)

# Update stage progress
performance_monitor.update_stage_progress(AnalysisStage.DATA_GATHERING, 50, "file_structure")

# Complete a tool
performance_monitor.complete_tool(AnalysisStage.DATA_GATHERING, "file_structure")
```

### Getting Progress Data
```python
# Get comprehensive progress data
progress_data = performance_monitor.get_progress_data()

# Access specific information
overall_progress = progress_data['overall_progress']
current_stage = progress_data['current_stage']
stages = progress_data['stages']
```

## Benefits Over ETA System

### ‚úÖ Advantages
1. **Real-time visibility** - Users see exactly what's happening
2. **No misleading estimates** - Progress is based on actual completion
3. **Better user experience** - Clear indication of work being done
4. **Debugging friendly** - Easy to see where analysis might be stuck
5. **Stage-specific insights** - Users understand the analysis process

### ‚ùå Previous ETA Issues
1. **Inaccurate estimates** - ETAs were often wrong
2. **No real progress indication** - Users couldn't see actual work
3. **Confusing time displays** - Remaining time vs. elapsed time confusion
4. **No stage visibility** - Users didn't know what was happening

## Implementation Details

### ProgressTracker Class
The core progress tracking is handled by the `ProgressTracker` class in `src/utils/performance_monitor.py`:

```python
class ProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stages: Dict[AnalysisStage, StageProgress] = {}
        self.current_stage: Optional[AnalysisStage] = None
        self.overall_progress: float = 0.0
        self.start_time: Optional[float] = None
```

### Stage Weights
Each stage has a weight that determines its contribution to overall progress:
- Initialization: 5%
- Data Gathering: 25%
- Code Analysis: 30%
- Security Scan: 15%
- Quality Assessment: 15%
- Visualization: 5%
- AI Summary: 5%
- Finalization: 0%

### Thread Safety
All progress updates are thread-safe using locks to prevent race conditions during concurrent analysis.

## Migration from ETA System

The old ETA system has been preserved for backward compatibility but is no longer used in the UI. The new progress system provides:

1. **Better accuracy** - Based on actual tool completion
2. **More information** - Stage-by-stage breakdown
3. **Real-time updates** - Live progress indication
4. **Better UX** - Clear visual feedback

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the progress system:
1. **Predictive progress** - Use historical data for better estimates
2. **Stage timeouts** - Alert users if stages take too long
3. **Progress persistence** - Save progress for long-running analyses
4. **Custom stage weights** - Allow users to customize stage importance
5. **Progress analytics** - Track performance over time
